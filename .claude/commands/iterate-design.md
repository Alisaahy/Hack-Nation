**CREATE DESIGN VARIATIONS**

UI TO BUILD: $ARGUMENTS #L to chat, IK to generate

**GOAL**
Your goal is to spin up 3 parallel sub agents concurrently to implement one UI
with variations,
So that users can review and decide which one is better;
**Task for each sub agent**
1. Analyse the style guide in prd/design-system.json, as well as mockups for reference
2. Build one single html page of just one screen to build a UI based on users’ feedback/task
3. Output html in ui_iterations folder as ui_{n}.html (Where n needs to be unique like ui_1.html, ui_2.html, etc.)
